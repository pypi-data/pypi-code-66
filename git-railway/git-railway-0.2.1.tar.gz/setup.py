Use the `-o` or\n`--output` option to override the default location, e.g.\n\n~~~ shell\ngit-railway --output /tmp/mytemprailwaygraph.html\n~~~\n\nIf you want to include all the remote branches to the railway graph, you can\npass the `-a` or `--all` option, e.g.\n\n~~~ shell\ngit-railway --all\n~~~\n\nIf the remote repository is hosted on GitHub, issue and PR\nreferences are replaced with actual links. If the GitHub slug derived from the\nremotes is wrong, you can override it with the `--gh` option, e.g.\n\n~~~ shell\ngit-railway --gh p403n1x87/git-railway\n~~~\n\n\n# Details\n\n## There\'s no such thing as *branch* in Git!\n\nAs you probably know already, a branch in git is a mere reference (or label)\nthat moves with every new commit. As such, it\'s hard if not impossible to\nreconstruct the *actual* branch from the information available from within a git\nrepository. This tools works by looking at the current local refs and collecting\nall the commits that can be reached from them. The "branches" are the\nreconstructed "best effort" by looking at the reflog to determine on which\ncommit a certain ref has been on. Sometimes this information is missing. For\nexample, when one does a merge by fast-forwarding, all the intermediate commits\nare not marked with the ref of the target branch. Should they be part of the\nbranch or not? Whenever you see a piece of grey rail in the graph, that\'s where\nthe ref information is missing.\n\n## Chrono-topological ordering\n\nTo complicate things even more, there can be cases where a parent commit has a\ntimestamp which is in the *future* with respect to some of its children. Hence,\nthe trivial chronological ordering does not always work. Furthermore, one can\nalso have precision issues; if one creates multiple commits in quick succession,\nthey are likely to end up having the same timestamp. Topological order, on the\nother hand, is not optimal either in its own. For what if we have some stale\nbranches that were never merged? They might end up at the very top of the graph,\neven though its commits are quite old.\n\nThe solution is a mix of chronological and topological sorting. For example, we\ncan start by sorting all the commits based on their timestamp, and then make\nsome changes to Kahn\'s algorithm to ensure that we position oldest commits\nfirst. With the chronological sorting step at the beginning, the complexity is\n`O(n log n)`.\n',
